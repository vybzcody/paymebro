Qualification Requirements
The app should have integrated the MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDKs (Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs) and use social/email login for instant, seedless wallet creation and management.

The dApp should be deployed on the Solana blockchain. If opting for the cross chain track, it should be Solana + any other chain.

Use any of the following SDKs based on your platform:

Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDK:

React Hooks: SDK Reference, Examples

Vue Composables: SDK Reference, Examples

JavaScript (for all frameworks): SDK Reference, Examples

Web3Auth Plug and Play Mobile SDKs:

Android: SDK Reference, Examples

iOS: SDK Reference, Examples

React Native: SDK Reference, Examples

Flutter: SDK Reference, Examples

Web3Auth Plug and Play Gaming SDKs

Unity: SDK Reference, Examples

Unreal: SDK Reference, Examples

The demo should have a working MetaMask Embedded Wallet integration depicted in the main flow of the application.

Maximum prize that can be earned by a team: $5000 ( Best Overall)

Teams can choose to participate in multiple tracks at once, but will be considered only for one track by the judges for being a winner

The judges can choose to reward a team Best Overall, without them winning a track prize

The judges can decide not to reward a track prize if no project meets the standards set by them internally, apart from the basic submission criteria.

Submission Requirements
Demo & Code:

Submit a working demo (live or recorded video) showing key features.

Provide access to source code (GitHub or similar), with clear instructions for setup and testing.

Documentation:

Include a brief README or documentation explaining:

Project goals and features

How Web3Auth is integrated

Instructions for running the demo

Pitch:

Submit a short project description (100–300 words) outlining the problem, solution, and impact.

Judging Focus:
Innovation & Creativity

Practicality & Real-World Impact

Effortless onboarding and delightful User Experience (UX)

Technical Execution

Innovative use of MetaMask Embedded Wallet (Web3Auth) SDKs

Solana onboarding kit with SNS

Create sharable link to “Onboarding Kit”. Links to web to begin onboarding process, or bonus if mobile app. First step to create embedded wallet, in this flow - create “username” or SNS domain/ subdomain, and automatically set as primary with short tooltips/demos.

AI-Powered Web3 Agents & Autonomous dApps

Build decentralized applications or agents that leverage artificial intelligence for automation, personalization, or smart contract execution.

Projects should showcase how decentralized AI can drive smarter contracts, autonomous DAOs, or user-facing agents (e.g., chatbots, workflow bots) that operate on-chain. Use embedded wallets to streamline user onboarding, asset management, or transaction approvals, but let the AI-driven experience shine.

Possible Directions:

AI-enhanced smart contracts

Autonomous DAOs with AI governance

Personalized, AI-driven DeFi or NFT recommendations

On-chain AI agents for portfolio management

Cross-Chain Interoperability & Asset Movement

Drive solutions for effortless movement and management of assets or identities across multiple blockchains with seamless user experience.



Applications that enable DeFi transactions, NFT transfers, or user authentication across several chains including Solana and EVMs. Embedded wallets should abstract away complexity, enabling users to access and move assets or data wherever they want.


Possible Directions:

Cross-chain DeFi (liquidity routing, yield farming, instant swaps)

NFT or token bridges connecting Solana and EVM ecosystems

Universal multi-chain logins and identity management

Dashboards displaying assets/status across multiple blockchains

Solana Everyday Impact: Consumer & Community App

Showcase how Solana’s performance and Web3Auth’s embedded wallets make everyday web experiences (like social platforms, creator tools, or local commerce) more democratic, private, and user-empowering.

Consumer applications where end-users own their data, monetize content, or interact with communities in new ways using seamless wallet onboarding and Solana’s scalability. The focus is on practical use, privacy, and real-world value for non-crypto natives.

Possible Directions:

Decentralized social networks with user content ownership

Mobile/web event ticketing employing wallet-based QR access

Peer-to-peer tipping, social rewards, or creator payments

Secure, private messaging or sharing platforms

Tokenization of Real-World Assets & Digital Identity

Bring tangible assets and user identity credentials onto blockchains, creating new experiences and opportunities for ownership, access, and verification.

Projects that tokenize assets (real estate, commodities, collectibles) or digitize credentials (education, employment, supply chain) and make management frictionless with embedded wallets and decentralized identity frameworks.

Possible Directions:

Trading platforms for tokenized real estate or collectibles

Self-sovereign identity wallets storing verifiable credentials

Applications enabling supply chain traceability or authenticity checks

Gateways to real-world access (memberships, certifications) via on-chain credentials

Programmable Commerce & DeFi for Everyone

Unlock programmable, automated, and accessible financial tools for the mainstream democratizing complex DeFi and commerce protocols.

User-centric DeFi or commerce solutions that make automation (bill splitting, recurring payments, dynamic rewards) simple and transparent. Projects should leverage embedded wallets for onboarding and ongoing asset management.

Possible Directions:

Automated bill splitting or group payments for friends, families, clubs

Subscription services or pay-per-use APIs/paywalls

“One-click” DeFi aggregators simplifying asset allocation and strategies

Community finance tools: micro-lending, pooled savings, dynamic rewards
